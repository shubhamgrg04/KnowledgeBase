# Surfboard

> Surfboard is a chrome extension to help organise and highlight web content, using firestore for storage.

## Features

- Uses Firebase as database for storing highlighted selections
- Privacy focussed, all data is owned by user
- Free to use, typical user will never exceed the free tier limits offered by Firebase

## Philosophy

I have written more about the origins of Surboard [here](https://www.shubhamgrg.com/surfboard).

## Roadmap

- Cite lines in articles using Chrome's [Text Fragments](https://web.dev/text-fragments/).
- Analytics of personal browsing behaviour
- Shareable highlighted web pages using firebase functions.
